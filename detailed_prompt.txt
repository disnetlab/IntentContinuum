do not include "db-deployment" in the answer. try to provide optimize answer with the minimal changes and provide the most relevant actions.No explanation is needed, the reply should have the template only.
do not replace microservice1 to other nodes however you can use other actions for this pod.
if you see there is a "null" option for the placement of the pod, it means the selected node does not have sufficient resources to run another pod. So,try another approach.
Do not consider "Container host-sflow-sidecar" in the response anymore.
You need to strictly ensure that the recommendation you provide 100% can addresses the violation and also it avoids violating the minimum threshold. make sure to recommend the most appropriate action to solve the issue.
When you find the source of violation, give me the recommended actions based on that.
Do not focus on microservice4 very much. focus more on microservice1 and microservice3 which are the heavier ones.
